# Super-resolution-inference-and-for-android
In Tetrachrome/subpixel project, we can train the subpixel model, but the project did not give the inference code can super resolution an image any size,

1  Run python inference code: python predict.py ,you can get the supersolution in predicts, name is *_out.png

2  If you use youself model, first you can train you model use https://github.com/Tetrachrome/subpixel, and put it in checkpoint directory,
and then run python predict.py

3 In the meanwhile, you can get the model file for android in models directory(I don't know it is correct?)

4 In SuperResolutionAndroid is android inference use the model, but the result is not correct? I can't resolve the problem, can anyone can 
  contribute it?
